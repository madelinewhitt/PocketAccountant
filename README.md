# PocketAccountant
## About:
PocketAccountant is an application developed with the aim of assisting everyday individuals in managing their finances. It's also a personal project through which I sought to enhance my understanding of money management. Given my initial lack of knowledge in this area, I believed it would be beneficial to embark on this project, enabling me to educate myself while guiding others from basic money management concepts to more advanced techniques as I continue learning. I've worked on this project independently.
